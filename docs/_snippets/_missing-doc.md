:::danger **A Narrow Escape!**

You take a bold step forward—and suddenly stop.
The ground crumbles beneath your feet, revealing a yawning abyss.
A cold wind howls up from the depths, whispering of those who weren’t so lucky.

You take a cautious step back.
**Good choice.**

This doc isn’t here yet, but it might appear… if you’re patient.
For now, the **sidebar** is your safest route back to solid ground.
