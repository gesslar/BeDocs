**BeDoc** may be installed globally for use as a command, or
as a module within your own project.

## 1. Installation

Review the [Installation Guide](/start/installation) for details on
how to get and install BeDoc. After writing the two lovely paragraphs
below, I wanted to write something fun here. But, I couldn't think
of anything, so, insert your own fun statements, here:
