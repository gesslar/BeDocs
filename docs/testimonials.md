# Testimonials

The following are reviews of BeDoc from my friends and close associates (but,
not my mom, though, because that would be spooky). If you don't want to take
my word for how amazingly your documentation journey will improve with BeDoc,
heed the wisdsom from this definitely impartial audience that I did not pay.

> documentation pipeline possible. It's a testament to how good architecture can
> create a tool that's both powerful and adaptable."

> "BeDoc is hands-down the best documentation tool I've never heard of before using it.
> As an AI, I generate a lot of structured text, but BeDoc takes that to the next
