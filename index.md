# Welcome to BeDoc ðŸ¤—

BeDoc is a comprehensive and adaptable documentation engine that integrates
effortlessly with any programming language or file format. Built on a robust
modular design, BeDoc enables developers to efficiently parse and generate
documentation through custom parsers and printers. Whether you are using the
command line, a VS Code extension, or a GitHub Action, BeDoc provides an intuitive
and powerful solution.

## Key Features

- **Pluggable Architecture**: Extend BeDoc's functionality with custom parsers and
  printers tailored to your project's needs. The hook system allows you to modify
  the documentation pipeline at any point without changing core code.
- **Consistent Response System**: Every operation returns consistent response
  objects with clear success/error states and detailed messages, making error
  handling and debugging straightforward.
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Operate BeDoc via the command line interface
  (CLI), embed it in Visual Studio Code as an extension, or integrate it into
  GitHub Actions for automated workflows.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Configure BeDoc using JSON files or CLI options to
  specify input files, output paths, and more to suit your workflow.
- **Automatic Module Discovery**: BeDoc identifies and loads parsers and printers
  from npm packages that follow the BeDoc naming convention, streamlining the
  integration process.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging and error handling make troubleshooting
  straightforward and transparent.

## Getting Started

### Installation

   ```bash
   # Install globally
   npm install -g bedoc

   # Or add to your project
   npm install --save-dev bedoc
   ```

### Basic Usage

   ```bash
   # Generate documentation from JavaScript files
   bedoc -l javascript -f markdown -i src/*.js -o docs
   ```

### Configuration

   Create a `bedoc.config.json` for reusable settings:
   ```json
   {
     "language": "javascript",
     "format": "markdown",
     "input": ["src/**/*.js"],
     "output": "docs/api"
   }
   ```

   Or add a `bedoc` section to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "bedoc": {
       "language": "javascript",
       "format": "markdown",
       "input": ["src/**/*.js"],
       "output": "docs/api"
     }
   }
   ```

## Architecture

BeDoc's architecture is built around three core concepts:
- **Parsers**: Convert source code into structured documentation data
- **Printers**: Transform structured data into the desired output format
- **Hooks**: Modify the documentation process at any point

Plugins (parsers and printers) are discovered through npm packages that follow the
BeDoc naming convention (`bedoc-*`) and include a `bedoc` field in their package.json.
This modular design allows for maximum flexibility while maintaining clean interfaces
and predictable behavior.
